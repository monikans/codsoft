# CodSoft Internship - C++ Project

## Overview

This repository contains the work I completed during my internship at CodSoft, focusing on C++ programming. The objective of this internship was to enhance my understanding of C++ and to develop practical skills through hands-on projects.

## Learning Objectives

- Deepen knowledge of C++ syntax and semantics.
- Understand object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in C++.
- Gain experience with C++ Standard Library and algorithms.
- Develop problem-solving skills using C++.
- Apply C++ in real-world scenarios.

## Project Details

- **Project Name**: Number Guessing Game, To-Do List, Tic-Tac-Toe Game

- **Description**: 
  - **Number Guessing Game**: A simple console-based game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, helping the user narrow down the correct number.
  - **To-Do List**: A console-based task management application that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks. It helps users keep track of their daily tasks efficiently.
  - **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**: A classic two-player game implemented in C++ where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The game checks for winning conditions and declares a winner or a draw.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Number Guessing Game**:
    - Random number generation for dynamic gameplay.
    - User input validation to ensure correct input format.
    - Feedback mechanism to guide the user towards the correct guess.
  
  - **To-Do List**:
    - Add tasks with descriptions.
    - View all tasks in a neatly formatted list.
    - Delete tasks upon completion.

  - **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**:
    - User-friendly interface for input.
    - Game logic to check for win/draw conditions.
    - Reset functionality to start a new game after completion.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **IDE**: Online C++ Compiler (e.g., Replit, OnlineGDB, etc.)
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Standard C++ Libraries (no external libraries were used)

## Challenges and Learning Outcomes

- **Challenges Faced**:
  - Handling real-time input/output operations in an online environment.
  - Ensuring compatibility and smooth execution across different online compilers.
  - Debugging without traditional IDE tools and features.

- **What I Learned**:
  - Adaptability to different development environments, including online platforms.
  - Enhanced skills in writing portable and reliable C++ code.
  - Experience in managing projects without dependency on specific tools or IDEs.

## Future Improvements

- **Number Guessing Game**: Introduce more interactive features and user interface enhancements for a better online experience.
- **To-Do List**: Explore online storage solutions to save tasks across sessions.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**: Implement multiplayer functionality with remote players using online platforms.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank CodSoft for providing this internship opportunity and for their guidance throughout the project. Their support has been instrumental in enhancing my C++ programming skills.
